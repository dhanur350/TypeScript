TypeScript noob to pro

## What exactly is TypeScript
- It is a superset of JavaScript, So any valid TypeScript Code is a valid code for JavaScript, but TypeScript has additional features that current versipn of JavaScript do not have them, supported by most browsers out there.

- It has Object oriented features
- It catches errors in complie time, to get it fixed
- It has great tools rather than in JavaScript
